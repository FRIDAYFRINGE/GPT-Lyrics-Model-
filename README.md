# GPT-Lyrics-Model

This repository contains a custom GPT model trained to generate song lyrics based on a Spotify lyrics dataset. Inspired by the GPT-2 and GPT-3 architectures, the model has been scaled to about 50 million parameters for efficient generation primarily English and Spanish. With approximately 68 million tokens, the model aims to create lyrics that capture the diversity and stylistic nuances of contemporary music.

The model is trained on a collection of 100k+ song lyrics in English and Spanish sourced from Spotify. Lyrics are tokenized and processed to enhance model performance on sequences representative of real-world language use in lyrics.
